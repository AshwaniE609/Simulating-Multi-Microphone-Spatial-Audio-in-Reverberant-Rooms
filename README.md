## Project Overview

This repository contains a **MATLAB-based simulation pipeline** designed to generate realistic, multi-channel spatial audio data.  
The primary application is to create a **large-scale dataset** for the research and development of audio processing algorithms such as:
- Speech enhancement  
- Noise cancellation  
- Source localization  

The simulation programmatically models a **3D acoustic environment**, generates **Room Impulse Responses (RIRs)** using the image-source method, and convolves them with clean audio signals to produce reverberant audio as it would be captured by a **microphone array on a wearable device**.

---

## Key Features

- **Hardware Emulation**: Precise configuration of a virtual multi-microphone array to emulate device specifications.  
- **Advanced Acoustic Modeling**: Utilizes MATLAB's `imagesim` and `roomimpres` to generate realistic RIRs, capturing reflections and reverberations.  
- **Dynamic Scenario Generation**: Automates spatial scenarios by varying bystander source positions across radii and azimuths.  
- **Signal Processing Pipeline**: Includes convolution, mixing, gain compensation, and real-world noise addition.  
- **Scalable Dataset Creation**: Capable of generating tens of hours of labeled audio for deep learning.  

---

## Technical Stack

- **Environment**: MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)  
- **Required MATLAB Toolboxes**:
  - Array Toolbox (for `imagesim`, `roomimpres`)  
  - Audio Toolbox (for audio I/O and resampling)  

**Input Datasets**:
- **Clean Speech**: `.flac` or `.wav` files (e.g., LibriSpeech dataset)  
- **Ambient Noise**: Environmental recordings (e.g., FSDnoisy18k dataset)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-name>
Install MATLAB
Ensure MATLAB is installed with Array Toolbox and Audio Toolbox.
Download Input Data
Place clean speech files for "wearer" and "bystander" into input_audio/
Place environmental noise files into noise_dataset/


How to Use the Simulation
1. Configuration
Before running, open main_simulation.m and configure parameters at the top:

  %% Microphone and Room Setup
  mic1pos = [0.05; 0; 0];
  mic2pos = [-0.05; 0; 0];
  mic3pos = [0.08; 0.45; 0.04];
  mic4pos = [-0.08; 0.45; 0.04];
  mics = [mic1pos, mic2pos, mic3pos, mic4pos];
  
  room_size = [5, 4, 6]; % [Length, Width, Height] in meters
  
  %% Source Positions
  radii = [1, 2, 3];         % Radii for bystander movement
  phi_angles = 0:20:360;     % Azimuth angles in degrees
  
  %% Audio File Paths
  [wearer_audio, fs_wearer] = audioread('input_audio/1040-133433-0025.flac');
  [bystander_audio, fs_bystander] = audioread('input_audio/1040-133433-0009.flac');
  
  noise_folder = 'noise_dataset';   % Path to noise files
  
  %% Output Folder
  output_folder = 'final_noisy_outputs';

  
ðŸ‘‰ Update file paths to match your dataset.
2. Running the Script
Open MATLAB
Navigate to the repository directory
Open main_simulation.m
Run in the MATLAB Command Window:
main_simulation
The script processes all combinations of radii and angles, printing progress in the Command Window.
3. Understanding the Output
The script creates an output folder (default: final_noisy_outputs/) with:
4 .wav files â†’ one for each microphone channel
Format:
Audio10_output_r<radius>_phi<angle>_theta0_mic<mic_index>.wav
Example:
Audio10_output_r2_phi100_theta0_mic3.wav
1 .mat file â†’ contains a 4-channel matrix of final mixed/noisy audio
Format:
Audio10_matrix_r<radius>_phi<angle>_theta0.mat
Example:
Audio10_matrix_r2_phi100_theta0.mat
This structured output supports direct loading into analysis scripts or ML pipelines.
